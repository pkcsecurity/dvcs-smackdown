# DVCS Smackdown
-
This is an example website for Bootstrap that contains HTML, JS, and CSS, 
that we can all modify as desired.

Please, **use this as a chance to dry-fire the DVCS systems**, so submit
pull requests, fork, add things, blow things up, get a feel for it all
so we can have (experiential) personal preferences in our next discussion.
